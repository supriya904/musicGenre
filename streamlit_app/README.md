## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install the updated requirements (from project root)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Ensure You Have Trained Models
Make sure you have at least one trained model in the `models/` directory:
```bash
# Train a model if you haven't already
python train.py --model residual_cnn --epochs 50
```

### 3. Launch the Streamlit App
```bash
# From the project root directory
cd streamlit_app
streamlit run app.py
```

### 4. Open in Browser
The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

## How to Use

### Step 1: Load a Model
1. In the sidebar, select a trained model from the dropdown
2. Click "ðŸ”„ Load Model" to load it
3. Wait for the success confirmation

### Step 2: Upload Audio
1. Click "Choose an audio file..." in the upload section
2. Select any music file (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A)
3. The file will be automatically loaded and you'll see:
   - File information
   - Audio player
   - Waveform visualization

### Step 3: Get Predictions
1. Click "ðŸš€ Predict Genre" button
2. Wait for the analysis to complete
3. View your results:
   - **Main prediction** with confidence percentage
   - **Detailed confidence chart** for all genres
   - **Top 3 predictions** with medal rankings

### Step 4: Track History
- All predictions are automatically saved in the history table
- View past predictions with timestamps and model info
- Clear history when needed

## Supported Audio Formats

- **MP3**: Most common format
- **WAV**: Uncompressed audio
- **FLAC**: Lossless compression
- **M4A**: Apple's audio format

## Model Compatibility

The app works with any trained model from your project:
- ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) 
- Improved CNN
- Residual CNN
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Technical Details

### Audio Processing
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses the same MFCC features as training
- **Preprocessing**: Automatic normalization and formatting
- **Duration**: Processes full audio files (not limited to 30 seconds)

### Performance
- **Fast Inference**: Predictions typically complete in 1-3 seconds
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes files temporarily without storing permanently
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unsupported files or corrupted audio

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No trained models found"**
- Make sure you have `.h5` files in the `models/` directory
- Train at least one model using the main training scripts

**"Failed to load model"**
- Check that the model file isn't corrupted
- Ensure the model was saved properly during training

**"Audio processing error"**
- Verify the audio file isn't corrupted
- Try converting to a different format (MP3/WAV work best)
- Check file size (very large files may cause memory issues)

### Performance Tips
- **Use smaller audio files** (under 10MB) for faster processing
- **Close other applications** if experiencing memory issues
- **Use WAV format** for most reliable processing

## File Structure
