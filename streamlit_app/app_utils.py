        **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** are the key features used for music genre classification:
        
        **What they represent:**
        - Capture the shape of the spectral envelope
        - Mimic human auditory perception
        - Compress audio information into meaningful coefficients
        
        **Our Configuration:**
        - **13 MFCC coefficients** per time frame
        - **130 time steps** (covering 30 seconds of audio)
        - **Sample Rate:** 22,050 Hz
        - **Hop Length:** 512 samples (~23ms per frame)
        
        **Why MFCCs work for genre classification:**
        - Different genres have distinct spectral characteristics
        - MFCCs capture timbral information crucial for genre identification
        - Robust to noise and variations in recording quality

        - **Features (13):** 13 MFCC coefficients per time frame

        - **CNNs:** Detect local patterns in the spectral features
