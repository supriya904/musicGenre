- **Cultural Documentation**: Systematic classification of traditional music forms
- **Archive Organization**: Improve searchability of digital music collections
- **Preservation Priority**: Identify at-risk musical genres for preservation efforts

**Implementation for Cultural Institutions:**
```python
class CulturalHeritagePreservation:
    """
    Support cultural institutions in music preservation efforts
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.genre_classifier = HistoricalGenreClassifier()
        self.rarity_assessor = MusicalRarityAssessor()
        self.cultural_mapper = CulturalContextMapper()
    
    def analyze_heritage_collection(self, audio_collection):
        """Analyze cultural heritage music collection"""
        analysis_results = []
        
        for audio_file in audio_collection:
            # Genre classification with historical context
            genre_analysis = self.genre_classifier.classify_with_context(
                audio_file
            )
            
            # Assess cultural significance and rarity
            rarity_score = self.rarity_assessor.assess_rarity(
                genre_analysis, audio_file.metadata
            )
            
            # Map to cultural context
            cultural_context = self.cultural_mapper.map_to_culture(
                genre_analysis, audio_file.origin_data
            )
            
            analysis_results.append({
                'file': audio_file,
                'genre_classification': genre_analysis,
                'rarity_score': rarity_score,
                'cultural_context': cultural_context,
                'preservation_priority': self.calculate_priority(
                    rarity_score, cultural_context

        self.cultural_expert_network = CulturalExpertNetwork()
        self.genre_expansion_engine = GenreExpansionEngine()
    
    def process_community_contribution(self, contribution):
        """Process community-submitted genre definitions and examples"""
        # Community validation
        community_score = self.community_validator.validate(contribution)
        
        # Expert review for cultural accuracy
        expert_review = self.cultural_expert_network.review(contribution)
        
        # Integration assessment
        integration_feasibility = self.genre_expansion_engine.assess_integration(
            contribution
        )
        
        if all([community_score > 0.8, expert_review['approved'], 
                integration_feasibility['viable']]):
            # Integrate new genre knowledge
            self.genre_expansion_engine.integrate_genre(contribution)
            
            return {
                'contribution_status': 'accepted',
