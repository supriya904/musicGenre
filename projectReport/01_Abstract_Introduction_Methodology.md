# Music Genre Classification Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study

## Abstract

Music genre classification is a fundamental task in music information retrieval that has significant applications in music recommendation systems, content organization, and audio analysis. This project presents a comprehensive comparative study of different deep learning architectures for automatic music genre classification using the GTZAN dataset. We implemented and evaluated five distinct neural network models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Improved CNN with regularization, Residual CNN with skip connections, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

Our approach utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the primary audio features, extracting 13 MFCC coefficients across 130 time frames from 30-second audio segments. The study demonstrates that enhanced neural network architectures significantly outperform basic models, with our Residual CNN achieving the highest accuracy of 84.30%. We developed a complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, multiple model architectures, comprehensive evaluation metrics, experiment tracking, and a user-friendly web interface for real-time genre prediction.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Music genre classification is one of the most important tasks in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems. With the exponential growth of digital music content and streaming platforms, the need for automatic music organization and recommendation systems has become crucial. Traditional manual classification is time-consuming and subjective, making automated approaches essential for modern music applications.

The ability to automatically classify music genres has numerous practical applications:
- **Music Streaming Services**: Automatic playlist generation and music recommendation
- **Music Libraries**: Efficient organization and cataloging of large music collections
- **Music Production**: Assisting producers in understanding and creating genre-specific content
- **Music Research**: Analyzing trends and patterns in music evolution

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Manual music genre classification faces several challenges:
- **Scalability**: Human annotation cannot keep pace with the volume of new music releases
- **Subjectivity**: Genre boundaries are often fuzzy, leading to inconsistent classifications
- **Cost**: Manual classification requires significant human resources
- **Consistency**: Different annotators may classify the same music piece differently

These challenges motivate the development of automated systems that can consistently and efficiently classify music genres while maintaining high accuracy.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. **Comparative Analysis**: Systematically compare different deep learning architectures for music genre classification
2. **Feature Engineering**: Investigate the effectiveness of MFCC features for genre discrimination
3. **Model Enhancement**: Develop and evaluate improved neural network architectures with advanced techniques
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Establish comprehensive metrics for model comparison and validation
5. **Practical Implementation**: Create a complete system with user interface for real-world application

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

**Scope:**
- Classification of 10 music genres from the GTZAN dataset
- Implementation of 5 different neural network architectures
- Comprehensive evaluation using multiple performance metrics
- Development of web-based interface for practical usage

**Limitations:**
- Limited to 10 predefined genres from GTZAN dataset
- Audio segments restricted to 30-second duration
- Single feature type (MFCC) for audio representation
- Balanced dataset assumption (100 samples per genre)
